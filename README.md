# Data Analysis and Machine Learning Projects

This folder centralizes the Data Science projects I am developing, all organized according to the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology. This methodology provides a structured and flexible approach to the data analysis process, applicable to various tasks such as descriptive analysis, statistical inference, and predictive modeling. The structured folder organization below facilitates the development and maintenance of all projects, enabling a reproducible and scalable approach. Additionally, this repository will serve as a showcase for my projects as well as a personal reference, allowing continuous tracking and evolution of my analyses and models.

## Directory Structure

### `/_analyzes`
This folder contains files and scripts dedicated to **data analysis**. Here, you will find notebooks and code related to data exploration and different types of analysis, such as:

- **Descriptive Analyses**: Initial data exploration, summarization, and visualization.
- **Inferential Analyses**: Application of statistical tests and inferences to draw conclusions from the data.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Building machine learning or statistical models for forecasting and trend analysis.

### `/_envs`
Contains the environment configuration files to ensure that project dependencies are correctly managed. These files are used to create and maintain specific work environments using Conda. All environments have the same name as the respective notebook, facilitating organization and consistency across projects.

```bash
conda env create -f _envs/environment_name.yml
```
